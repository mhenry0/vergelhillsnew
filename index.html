        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; font-size: 20px;">
        Vergel is located between Tres Rios and Ojochal, it is still a very new zone for investors. People are still pin pointing it because it has remained hidden unlike neighboring towns.
        <br>
        <br>
      However, it does not mean that the land has less value, it is the opposite; the sellers are so scarce that this is a paradise for those who are looking for a tranquil hideaway. Few people own the lands here, and they are selling few lots; it will not be residential, condominimum or similar, we are trying to promote a minded impact on the enviroment.
    
      <br>
      <br>
      So, if you are looking for a land to build your tropical house, a hideaway from the world, a retreat center, or a hotel, we have it here. All the lands have had a background check and they are ready to build. Our request is to be minded about your actions in the future; the less impact the better.
